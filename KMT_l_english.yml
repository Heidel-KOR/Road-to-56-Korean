Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as [Root.GetLeader] in [Root.Capital.GetName] announced that [CHI.GetName] will follow the fascist path. All oppositions are immediately put to silence in hours.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.18.d_nl:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. [Root.GetLeader] is now calling for a transition into fascism.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by some of the [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but it has angered [Root.GetLeader] greatly. If we do not act now, [Root.GetLeader] may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.10.d_nl:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. [Root.GetLeader] is disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetRulingParty].\n\n[Root.GetLeader] remain certain that the people will eventually pick up their sense of pride, but is hesitating on what course of action to take. Some of the supporters call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
